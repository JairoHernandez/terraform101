### 35. Input Variable Value Selecion Order

It's bettter to leave all of these blank than to have assigned a value to more than one method here 
because it can cause unsuspecting outage with your code, so you have to then go hunt down the 
pesky variable has been assigned more than once.

Order in wchi TF applies variables:

    TF_VAR environment variables (most secure, but poses most risk for malconfifugratio, so use sparingly)
        Use for secrets or values that need to introduced programmatically or dynamically.
    default terraform.tfvars
        Use for application wide settings that do not need to change for each environment.
        Create a .tfvars file for each environment dev test, prod stage, perf test, load test, whatever you name it.
        If you're going to provision it, create a .tfvars file for it and call it a day.
    *.auto.tfvars (where * can be something.something.something)
    -var cli option
    -var-file cli option
    old fashion manual input(which hopefully is never used)
